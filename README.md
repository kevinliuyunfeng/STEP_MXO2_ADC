# STEP_MXO2_ADC
This is a summer practice project that I participated in at eetree. The project is based on the STEP-FPGA comprehensive skills training board, using ADC to make a digital voltmeter. The specific functions are as follows: display the voltage value on the OLED screen on the board, and pass The button can lock the voltage value, which is equivalent to the HOLD function on the upper end of the multimeter.
